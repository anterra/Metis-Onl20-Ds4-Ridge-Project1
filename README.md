For this project, we analyzed MTA Subway Station data for the WomenTechWomanYes (WTWY) organization. The purpose of this analysis is for WTYS 
to understand how to optimize their workers at the busiest subway stations, in order to gather email addresses for both increasing their knowledge
base and the upcoming gala.
